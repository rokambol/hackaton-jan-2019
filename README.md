January Hackathon project.

The project entailed creating a website with a New Year/Winter theme.
A New Year's Eve celebration theme was the one we decided to use.
A series of the most famous cities world-wide were chosen, and a header, 
paragraph and photo were selected to show how New Year's Eve was celebrated there in 2019.
A video was embedded at the bottom of the page which showed the celebrations.
Tasks were divided up between the team and executed separately, but with constant contact through Zoom.
Goals and checklists were created in a shared Trello page.
